Discovering new dApps is easier than ever thanks to the [Discover dApps](https://dap.ps/) dAppStore!

Launched in collaboration with Status, the Discover dApps dAppStore helps users find and share their favorite dApps.

In addition to our decentralized protocol enabling lending and borrowing for margin trading, bZx Network supports the development of the 
DeFi ecosystem through projects like [Fulcrum](https://fulcrum.trade/) (decentralized lending), [Torque](torque.loans), and 
the [SAI iToken](https://etherscan.io/token/0x14094949152eddbfcd073717200da82fed8dc960?a=0x81eed7f1ecbd7fa9978fcc7584296fb0c215dc5c) 
(tokenized margin loans).

Our protocol enables users to lend and borrow cryptocurrency and create leveraged long and short positions of their digital assets.

The bZx protocol is also used by DeFi products including DexWallet, Eidoo, Uniswap, Totle, Betoken, and DeFiZap.

Making dApps more accessible is a critical step in encouraging their adoption. Having a dAppStore like Discover dApps helps DeFi supporters
keep up with the latest dApps and makes it easier for them to share with others.

Users can search for dApps by category, vote in support of their favorite dApps, and submit new dApps to the platform.

##2020 is just getting started
This year, the bZx team aims to to improve liquidity for dApps using bZx protocol by increasing awareness of bZx, Fulcrum, and Torque and 
continuing to improve the platforms.

We're excited to continue supporting the growth of the DeFi ecosystem with a new dApp called Archimedes (details coming soon)
and through our ongoing collaborations with leading DeFi startups like MakerDAO, Chainlink, Kyber Network, Augur, and DeFiPulse.

"We're happy to provide mobile-optimized lending, borrowing, and margin trading capabilities to the Status dApp store, enabling a novel 
suite of functionalities for Status users."
