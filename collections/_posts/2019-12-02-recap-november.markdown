We had a very busy November at bZx, so here is our monthly newsletter “The Shipping Manifest” with key takeaways.

## Visual Identity Updated

We updated our visual identity and redesigned the [bZx protocol website](https://bzx.network). Our new branding aimed to strengthen brand recognition for products built with the bZx protocol. You can find our media assets on [this page](/media-assets). We also migrated our twitter handle to a new one: [@bzxHQ](https://twitter.com/bzxHQ)

## Multi Collateral DAI on Fulcrum and Torque

One of the most important events past month was the MakerDAO transition to a Multi Collateral DAI. We published our [MCD transition plan](/mcd-transition-plan), and already enabled new DAI markets on Fulcrum for trading and lending:

New DAI enabled as well on Torque for borrowing and to use as collateral in loans:
